<h2>User Group Connect</h2>
<p>
  Join us as we get as many technical user groups as we can together in the same room
  to see what will happen.
</p>
<h3>Why would we do this?</h3>
<p>
  Not everyone knows about all the user groups - the user groups are doing
  very interesting stuff and sometimes complementary things that would benefit
  from knowledge of the topics in other user groups.  We want to get these
  do-ers in the same room together where they can collaborate with and learn
  from each other.
</p>
